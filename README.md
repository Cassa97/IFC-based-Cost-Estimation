The goal of the project is to create a dynamic query to query the model and create lists of objects from which to extract quantities; at this point the unit costs for the identified elements from which to extract the unit cost value will be identified. Finally, the cost estimation item (IfcCostItem) will be created and a new IFC model with cost data will be saved. In this way it will also be possible to define a cost estimate (IfcCostSchedule).n this way it will also be possible to define a cost estimate (IfcCostSchedule).

The FlowChart is:

The IFC input compare to IFC output is (using FZK Viewer):

The IFC file with the new relations between object entities and cost entities can also be viewed through the USBIM viewer developed by ACCA. Below is the link to the page to view the otherwise downloadable template in the "IFC_output" folder.
