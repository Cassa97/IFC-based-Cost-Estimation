# IFC-based Cost Estimation

The goal of the project is to create a dynamic query to query the model and create lists of objects from which to extract quantities; at this point the unit costs for the identified elements from which to extract the unit cost value will be identified. Finally, the cost estimation item (IfcCostItem) will be created and a new IFC model with cost data will be saved. In this way it will also be possible to define a cost estimate (IfcCostSchedule).n this way it will also be possible to define a cost estimate (IfcCostSchedule).
